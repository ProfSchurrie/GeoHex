/*
 * Project: GeoHex
 * File: Player.cs
 * Author: SÃ¶ren Coremans
 * Description:
 * Networked player entity. Manages nation selection workflow, per-player TradeOffer,
 * and links to the owned Nation object. The server authoritatively assigns nations and
 * transfers ownership of spawned network objects to the owning client.
 *
 * Flow:
 *  1) Owner calls RequestNation(n).
 *  2) Server observes request; if available, spawns Nation, assigns id/ownership,
 *     updates country and countryAssigned.
 *  3) Client UI closes the selector when assignment is confirmed.
