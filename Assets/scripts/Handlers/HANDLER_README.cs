/*
 * Project: GeoHex
 * Folder: /Scripts/UI/
 * Description:
 * This folder contains all user interface handler scripts for GeoHex.
 * Each class in this folder is responsible for connecting UI elements
 * (buttons, sliders, dropdowns, etc.) to functions in the HexMapEditor,
 * HexGrid, or related game systems.
 *
 * These scripts do not contain game logic themselves — they merely:
 *  • Register UI callbacks (e.g., button.onClick, slider.onValueChanged)
 *  • Call relevant editor or manager functions when triggered
 *  • Update displayed labels or text fields to reflect game state
 *
 * In short:
 *  → These are glue scripts for the UI layer, not gameplay code.
